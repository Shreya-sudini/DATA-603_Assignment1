# BIG DATA
Big data is huge amount of data that is very complex to process and analyze.

## Examples
These days big data is generated everywhere.
+ Healthcare - The Electronic health records(EHRs) that contain patient data, medical history, lab results, etc
+ Social media data - The data generated from various applications like Twitter, Instagram, Snapchats in the form of text, images, videos, audios.
+ Finance - Transactional data from banking, exchanges in stock markets
+ Streaming data - Platforms like Netflix, Spotify, Youtube stream huge number of videos.
+ Sensor data - The data collected from various sensors in embedded systems for analysis.

## Types 
Big data can come in many types such as Batch, Streaming, Graph, Spatio-temporal, tables, 

## 6V's of Big Data
Big data can be characterized by 6V's which are volume, velocity, veracity, variability, variety, value.

+ ### Volume
  It is the amount of data that is generated that is too difficult to process and analyze.
+ ### Velocity
  The speed at which the data is generated. Some data such as social media data, streaming data come at high velocities.
+ ### Veracity
  It is the quality and accuracy of the data. To analyze and process the data it needs to be cleaned and in good quality to extract good value out of it. 
+ ### Variability
  As the data is generated at high velocity and sometimes at slow velocities, there can be inconsistencies in the data. 
+ ### Variety
  There is variety of data of coming in. Big data can come as structured, unstructured and semi-structured data. Structured data refers to tables, unstructed are files with text, video, audio and semi-structured refer to metadata, XML files, JSON files.
+ ### Value
  The end goal of big data analytics is to extract value for a purpose. Values refers to usefulness of the data to achieve a goal after subjecting the data to analysis.

## Phases of Big Data Analysis
There are 5 phases of Big Data Analysis:

+ ### Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Recording
  There is ton of data generated from many sources such as sensors, social media, satellites, etc, from which by applying filters we can collect the necessary data for processing. Metadata can be generated on how and what data was recorded . For example, the sensor records the data along with the timestamp and the date is was generated.
+ ### Phase 2: Information extraction and cleaning
+ ### Phase 3: Data integration, Aggregation and Representation
+ ### Phase 4: Query Processing, Data Modelling and Analysis
+ ### Phase 5: Interpretation
